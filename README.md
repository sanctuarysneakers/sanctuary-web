# Sanctuary
An application designed for clients to efficiently find the best possible deal for any high-end clothing item they desire.

## THE MISSION
Sole Steal aspires to be a marketplace curated for the individual, where users can not only buy and sell shoes for wearing, but also as a proper and valid means of commodity exchange. It will be the first retail marketplace to efficiently harness data in order  to find the best possible deals for each user, to create a truly personalized online shopping experience, and serve as a means of not only shopping, but true investment for clients. 

#### THE LONG RUN
- Sole Steal will start small and grow to fill the market in which it resides (online shopping/reselling/marketplaces). In the long run, Sole Steal will become a cutting edge, leading online retailer for peer to peer clothing transactions. In addition to this, it will track sneaker markets using big data tools and historical analysis, and develop proprietary software to treat the market as a real commodities exchange. This will allow clients to forecast future prices, buy and sell shoes according to market swings, and bring statistical validity to the idea of "flipping shoes".

#### THE SHORT RUN
- An idea as ambitious as this must start small. In order to ensure scalable growth, agile methodologies, and a secure infrastructure, Sole Steal will begin as a place to compare prices on various sneakers in order to find the current best deals. As it grows and data begins being stored, more will be added. But as I write this on June 18th 2020, the short term vision for Sole Steal is to simply offer users a place to find the best possible deals on sneakers.
